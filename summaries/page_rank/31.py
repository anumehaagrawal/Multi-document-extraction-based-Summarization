summary = ["NASA has only five minutes or less each day to launch Endeavour in order to meet up with the first space station part, which was put in orbit two weeks ago by the Russians.The two station pieces are so big  77 feet from the tip of one to the tip of the other with a combined mass of 70,000 pounds  that Currie and her crewmates were going to have to rely on a computerized vision system and camera views, rather than direct line of sight Once she was sure she had it, Cabana fired Endeavour's thrusters, and the brief burst raised the shuttle and thereby Unity enough for the docking mechanisms on the two station components to snap together"]
